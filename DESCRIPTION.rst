Qwiic EEPROM Py
=============================================

Add some serious data storage to your latest project with this 512Kbit (64KB) EEPROM. 
Some flash based microcontrollers (like the SAMD21) do not have EEPROM. Use the Qwiic 
EEPROM for storing things like GPS waypoints and other user settings that need to be 
maintained between sketch uploads. Qwiic EEPROM has 3 address jumpers, allowing for up 
to 8 EEPROMs on one bus.
